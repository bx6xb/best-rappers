Jenner gave birth to their son in February 2022.<h3>Controversies and legal issues</h3><div class="sep"></div>Incidents at performances<br><br>Scott's performances have experienced a number of issues. At Lollapalooza in 2015, Scott was charged and arrested for disorderly conduct after inciting concertgoers to ignore security and rush the stage. That same year, at the Openair Festival in Switzerland, he encouraged fans to attack a man who took his shoe while he was crowd-surfing, by stopping the concert and repeatedly telling the crowd to "fuck him up", while also spitting on him.<br><br>In 2017, he was arrested for similar conduct to his Lollapalooza behavior after a performance in Northwest Arkansas. That same year, a fan sued Scott and the organizers of a 2017 concert at Terminal 5 in Manhattan after falling from a balcony and being dragged on stage, blaming the fall on a crowd surge. In 2019, three people were trampled and injured as a crowd rushed to enter the compound at Astroworld.<br><br>Astroworld Festival crowd crush<br><br>On November 5, 2021, at least ten people died and hundreds were injured in a crowd crush moving toward the stage during Scott's performance at the Astroworld Festival in NRG Park in his hometown of Houston, Texas. On the first night, a crowd crush occurred, resulting in the deaths of at least nine people and the cancellation of the second night of the festival. In video footage of the incident, Scott is seen doing the following: continuing to perform despite chants from the crowd pleading for him to stop; observing at least one audience member had been hurt, then ordering security for a brief moment to "help, jump in real quick, keep going", only to continue with the rest of the show for the following hour; encouraging people to "get wild" and "crazy", despite an ambulance passing through the crowd that was pulling out lifeless bodies. Victims killed ranged from 9 to 27 years old.<br><br>In the aftermath of the crush, news outlets highlighted Scott's history of dangerous disregard for audience safety. Rolling Stone featured a statement from a fan who had been paralyzed during a 2017 show; The New York Times took note of Scott's 2015 guilty plea for reckless endangerment after he encouraged fans to climb security barricades; a Los Angeles Times article contained analysis by safety experts arguing that the deaths were preventable. Among other points of criticism was the fact that Scott halted his performance in 2015, when an audience member stole his shoe, ordering the crowd to beat up the person responsible. Shortly after, a lawsuit was announced by the concertgoers. It was started by Kristian Paredes, who filed for $1,000,000 due to the injuries he received.<br><br>Nebula assault allegations<br><br>On March 1, 2023, Scott was performing at Nebula, a nightclub in New York City, alongside Don Toliver when a sound technician, identified only as Mark, asked Scott to lower the music as it was too loud for the venue's size. Scott reportedly responded by giving Mark the finger and punched him in the head, resulting in Mark needing medical attention and police being called to the scene around 3:25 a.m. Scott had reportedly been drinking alcohol and damaged $12,000 in the club's sound equipment before he left the premises. The New York City Police Department issued a warrant for Scott's arrest in relation to the incident on March 2, 2023.</div></div><div class="col-12 rapper-info-section" hidden><div class="albums"><h3>Utopia</h3><img src="../img/3fb39f8101eee7a6b76b.jpg" alt="utopia album" title="utopia album"><div class="album-desc">Utopia is the fourth studio album by American rapper Travis Scott.
