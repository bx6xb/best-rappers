Vert, is an American rapper, singer, and songwriter. They are
characterized by their facial tattoos, facial piercings, eccentric
hairstyles and androgynous fashion, imagery built on a melodic
approach to trap. Born and raised in Philadelphia, Lil Uzi Vert gained
initial recognition following the release of the commercial mixtape
Luv Is Rage (2015), which led to a recording contract with Atlantic
Records, to whom they signed under DJ Drama's Generation Now imprint.<br><br>Lil Uzi Vert attracted mainstream attention following the release of
their debut single "Money Longer" in 2016. The song would act as the
lead single for the subsequent mixtape Lil Uzi Vert vs. the World
(2016), which also contained the song "You Was Right". After releasing
two additional mixtapes in 2016 and 2017, including one in
collaboration with Gucci Mane, Lil Uzi Vert was featured on the
Billboard Hot 100 chart-topping Migos' single "Bad and Boujee". They
later secured their first top ten single with "XO Tour Llif3", which
won the MTV Video Music Award for Song of Summer.<br><br>"XO Tour Llif3" acted as the lead single to Lil Uzi Vert's debut
studio album Luv Is Rage 2 (2017), which debuted at number one on the
Billboard 200, and was certified double platinum by the Recording
Industry Association of America (RIAA). At the 2018 Grammy Awards, Lil
Uzi Vert was nominated for Best New Artist. Their second studio album,
Eternal Atake (2020), was among the most anticipated albums in
contemporary trap and rap when it was finally released following
years' worth of delays. Eternal Atake, like Luv Is Rage 2, debuted at
number one on the Billboard 200.<h3> Early life</h3><div class="sep"></div>Symere Woods was born July 31, 1995, in North Philadelphia's
Francisville neighborhood. They grew up listening to Mike Jones and
Ying Yang Twins; Jones' debut album was the first album they
purchased. Woods later began listening to Wiz Khalifa and Meek Mill,
who influenced their future style. They also began listening to
Marilyn Manson, Paramore, Smash Mouth, The Rocket Summer, Simian, My
Chemical Romance, and The All-American Rejects when they were 13 years
old, and have said they are a "big Marilyn Manson fan" and called
Mechanical Animals their favorite album.<br><br>Woods began rapping in tenth grade, calling themself a "regular kid, I
didn't really wanna rap", after hearing classmate William Aston
freestyle over a remade Chris Brown instrumental. Woods, Aston and
another friend created a rap group, Steaktown, which broke up when
Woods was 17.<br><br>Woods dropped out of school and soon started working at a Bottom
Dollar store, but they quit after four days and were kicked out of
their home by their mother. The situation led to Woods getting their
first face tattoo, the word "Faith" under their hairline, which
provoked them to take their rap career seriously.<br><br>In July 2021, Woods revealed on a tweet that their birth certificate
shows they were born in 1995, after erroneously believing they were
born one year earlier.<h3> Career</h3><div class="sep"></div>2010–2015: Career beginnings<br><br>Woods began to rap in 2010 and began to associate with musical groups
like Steaktown and in what they say was "just for money" under the
name "Sealab Vertical". They later changed their name to Lil Uzi Vert
from the way someone described their rap flow, saying their flow was
"Fast, like a machine gun." Woods' first project, an EP titled Purple
Thoughtz Vol. 1 was released on January 19, 2014. The project, which
was described as "phonk" and having cloud rap beats from The Guardian
due to its psychedelic and "trippy" production features Woods with a
bigger focus on lyricism than most of their career and was released
with the single "White Shit" which included a video. The track, which
was produced by Spaceghostpurrp, went viral in 2017 within hip-hop
circles following Wood's entry into the mainstream. Shortly after the
release of Purple Thoughtz Vol. 1, Woods caught the attention of then
industry-mainstays like the ASAP Mob.<br><br>The project and following features caught the attention of producer
and Def Jam A&R Don Cannon after DJ Diamond Kuts played one of Woods'
songs on a local radio station, who signed Woods to their The Academy
imprint and produced their first mixtape, The Real Uzi which was
released on August 5, 2014. After the release of The Real Uzi, Woods
signed a record deal with Atlantic Records through DJ Drama, Don
Cannon's and Leighton Morrison's imprint, Generation Now.<br><br>Following their signing to Atlantic Records, Woods was featured
alongside Rich the Kid and ASAP Ferg on Carnage's single "WDYW". They
also released several songs on SoundCloud including the Metro Boomin
produced "No Wait", "Pressure" which is a collaboration with Lil Durk
and "Dej Loaf". They were featured on Fall Out Boy and Wiz Khalifa's
"Boys of Zummer" tour in August 2015. Woods released their second
mixtape, Luv Is Rage on October 30, 2015. The project, which features
production from then-bubbling producers such as Sonny Digital, TM88
and Maaly Raw with features from Billboard charting rappers such as
Wiz Khalifa and Young Thug, was received positively and was featured
on numerous music blogs such as Fader, XXL and Vibe. They were further
called a "breakout artist of 2015" by HotNewHipHop. <br><br>2016: Breakthrough<br><br>In January 2016, Lil Uzi appeared at an A$AP Mob show in New York City
to honor the deceased ASAP Yams. In February, they released the
single, "Money Longer" on their SoundCloud following a radio debut on
Shade 45. Controversy arose in March 2016 after a riot broke out at
SXSW's final day during Woods set. On April 15, 2016, Uzi released
their third mixtape and first commercial mixtape Lil Uzi Vert vs. the
World. The mixtape debuted at number 37 on the Billboard 200 chart,
making its Woods first entry on the chart. The project spent 55 weeks
on the Billboard 200 album chart, eventually being certified Gold.
Woods and Kodak Black embarked on a joint tour in May 2016, titled the
"Parental Advisory" tour.<br><br>In June 2016, Lil Uzi Vert appeared in XXL magazine as part of their
2016 Freshman Class. As part of this appearance, Uzi performed a
freshman cypher’ alongside Denzel Curry, Lil Yachty, 21 Savage, and
Kodak Black. As of December 2021, this cypher has received over 195
million YouTube views, by far the most for the XXL channel. Riding the
wave of recognition the XXL Freshman list gave them, Woods released
the video for the single "Money Longer" which debuted on the Billboard
Hot 100 the following week, their first entry on the chart, at number
92 on July 2, 2016. The song later peaked at number 54 and is
currently certified two-times platinum in the United States. Woods
second entry on the chart, Metro Boomin produced "You Was Right"
debuted at 89 on July 30, 2016, and peaked at number 40.<br><br>On July 12, 2016, Woods announced their fourth mixtape, The Perfect
LUV Tape, which was released on July 31, their 22nd birthday. The
mixtape featured the singles "Seven Million", featuring Future, and
"Erase Your Social", both of which failed to chart on the Billboard
Hot 100. The mixtape debuted at number 55 on the Billboard 200 album
chart and is certified Gold by the RIAA. In October 2016, Woods was
announced to be an additional artist on Canadian singer the Weeknd's
tour.<br><br>Woods announced a collaboration mixtape with Gucci Mane which was
released on November 23, 2016. On the 27th, Woods announced Luv Is
Rage 2 which eventually went through a series of delays.<br><br>2017: Luv Is Rage 2<br><br>Uzi featured on the hip-hop trio Migos' single "Bad and Boujee". The
single was released on October 28, 2016, and is from the trio's second
studio album, Culture (2017). In January 2017, around the time the
album released, the single peaked atop the US Billboard Hot 100,
becoming Uzi's first number 1 single as a lead or featured artist, and
their highest-charting single as both. On February 27, 2017, Woods
released the EP Luv Is Rage 1.5 while on tour with the Weeknd. The EP
was positively received for its "nerdy" nature with Kingdom Hearts
themed instrumentals and lyrics referring to anime, Steven Universe
and hentai. The EP was also credited as the start of Woods'
affiliation with the "Emo rapper" label due to the
heartbreak-associated lyrics on the song "Luv Scars K.o 1600" and
references to threats of suicide and depression on the stand-out track
"XO Tour Llif3".<br><br>"XO Tour Llif3"'s significant popularity on SoundCloud resulted in
Woods playing it live on the European leg of the Weeknd's tourand the
following week the song was added to streaming services and released
as an official single.On April 4, 2017, "Xo Tour Llif3" debuted on
Billboard Hot 100 at number 49 and peaked at number seven, becoming
the rapper's highest-charting song and biggest song, being certified
six-times platinum as of August 2018.<br><br>Luv Is Rage 2 was delayed again on April 2, 2017, with Woods blaming
it on DJ Drama. On April 9, Don Cannon confirmed the project wasn't
getting released "any time soon" and confirmed that "XO Tour Llif3"
would be on the album. Uzi was featured on fellow rapper Playboi
Carti's single "Woke Up Like This". It was released on April 7, 2017,
and is from Carti's debut commercial mixtape, Playboi Carti (2017).
The single was performed by the pair at Coachella 2017.<br><br>"Woke Up Like This" was eventually certified platinum and peaked at
number 76 on the Billboard Hot 100. Uzi was featured alongside ASAP
Rocky, Playboi Carti, Quavo and Frank Ocean on ASAP rappers collective
ASAP Mob's single "Raf". The single was released by surprise on May
15, 2017, and is from the collective's second studio album, Cozy Tapes
Vol. 2: Too Cozy. In early August, hip-hop media personality DJ
Akademiks claimed that Luv Is Rage 2 would release within 30 days. On
August 24, 2017, Luv Is Rage 2 was announced for a surprise release at
midnight and on August 25, 2017, Lil Uzi Vert released their heavily
delayed debut studio album, Luv Is Rage 2, which included top ten
single, "XO TOUR Llif3" as the lead single.<br><br>The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 albums chart,
with 135,000 album-equivalent units and has since been certified
platinum. The album also created ten Billboard Hot 100 charting
singles, with two, "The Way Life Goes", featuring Oh Wonder, and
"Sauce It Up" becoming singles. During British singer Ed Sheeran's set
at the Video Music Awards, Woods and Sheeran performed a medley of "XO
Tour Llif3" and Sheeran's chart-topping single, "Shape Of You".<br><br>In September 2017, Woods teased a possible sequel project to Lil Uzi
Vert vs The World possibly titled Lil Uzi Vert vs. The World 2 and a
collaboration project with Playboi Carti titled 16*29. In October, a
joint-tour with Playboi Carti called the "16*29 tour" was announced
further promoting the possibility of a collaboration project. The tour
was cancelled shortly thereafter due to Woods claiming they needed to
"focus". In October 2017, Woods headlined Power 105.1's annual
Powerhouse music celebration, alongside the Weeknd, Migos, and Cardi
B, at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York. Woods was also
featured on Canadian rapper Nav's platinum-certified single "Wanted
You". The song was released on November 3, 2017, Nav's 28th birthday,
and is from Nav's debut studio album, Reckless (2018).<br><br>On December 4, 2017, "The Way Life Goes" music video was released with

record producer Wheezy. In May 2018, Don Cannon confirmed that a new
Uzi project was dropping in 2018 and speculation arose in July 2018
when Woods tweeted the words "Eternal Atake", their second studio
album (2020), pinning the tweet and announcing it was "coming soon"
and then at the end of the month sharing the then-chosen cover art for
the project. The then-chosen cover art for Eternal Atake references
the logo of the cult Heavens Gate. The two members who survived the
cult suggested that legal actions could be taken against Uzi for
copying the logo style.<br><br>The art was the source of a threat from the two remaining members of
the organization over legal attack. The then-thought lead single from
Eternal Atake, "New Patek" was released on September 18, 2018. Uzi was
then featured on Lil Pump's single, "Multi Millionaire". The single
was released on October 5, 2018, and is from Pump's second studio
album, Harverd Dropout.<br><br>In April 2019, following label trouble with Generation Now, it was
announced that Uzi was now signed to Roc Nation. Two new promotional
singles were released in April 2019, titled "Sanguine Paradise" and
"That's a Rack", originally thought to be from their highly
anticipated studio album, Eternal Atake.<br><br>On December 13, 2019, Uzi released a new single titled, "Futsal
Shuffle 2020", which is the lead single of Eternal Atake. They then
released the second single of the album, titled "That Way", on March
1, 2020. Eternal Atake was released on March 6, 2020, with a sole
guest appearance from American singer Syd. The release date of the
album was a week earlier then fans expected it to release. "New
Patek", "That's a Rack" and "Sanguine Paradise" did not appear on the
album. Eternal Atake debuted atop the Billboard 200.<br><br>On March 12, 2020, Lil Uzi teased that the deluxe version of Eternal
Atake and the sequel to their July 2016 mixtape, Lil Uzi Vert vs. the
World, titled Lil Uzi Vert vs. the World 2, would release the
following day, the date fans expected the release date of the original
album. The deluxe edition would have fourteen new tracks, featuring
guest appearances from Chief Keef, 21 Savage, Future, Young Thug,
Gunna, Lil Durk, Young Nudy and Nav. The first half of the album
maintained a leading number 1 position (equal to 288,000 album sales
in the United States) with 400 million streams in early 2020, during
the COVID-19 pandemic. This marked the largest streaming count for any
album since 2018 when Lil Wayne's twelfth studio album, Tha Carter V,
got 433 million streams.<br><br>On April 24, 2020, Lil Uzi Vert released a new single titled "Sasuke",
the first since the release of the deluxe version of Eternal Atake. On
July 10, 2020, Lil Uzi appeared on the remix of StaySolidRocky's
"Party Girl". On July 21, 2020, Lil Uzi and Future hinted at an
upcoming joint project titled Pluto x Baby Pluto on their social
media. The two later released two new singles, "Patek" and "Over Your
Head", on July 31, which was Uzi's 26th birthday. Pluto x Baby Pluto
was released on November 13, 2020, and peaked at number two on the
Billboard 200. A deluxe version containing the two previously released
singles as well as 6 new tracks was released 4 days later on November
17.<br><br>2021–present: The Pink Tape<br><br>In late 2020, Lil Uzi Vert began promoting new singles on Instagram
live that were sonically similar to popular releases early in their
career. They subsequently announced an upcoming project titled Forever
Young, as well as a follow-up to Luv Is Rage 2 and a project to be
released exclusively on SoundCloud. On October 29, 2021, Lil Uzi Vert
released the single "Demon High", Awhich is expected to be the lead
single to their upcoming album The Pink Tape, which they have been
teasing to their fans since December 2020. In April 2022, Woods had
two guest appearances on the deluxe edition of American rapper Yeat's
2 Alive album, appearing as the featured on the songs "Big Tonka" and
"3G".<br><br>On July 12, 2022, Uzi announced an EP titled Red & White, which was
