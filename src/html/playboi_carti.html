Playboi Carti, is an American rapper. Carter was initially signed to
local underground label Awful Records prior to signing with ASAP Mob's
AWGE Label under Interscope Records. After gaining a cult following
early in his career, Carter garnered mainstream attention in 2017.<br><br>Carter's debut mixtape was released in April 2017, and
included the Billboard Hot 100 charting singles "Magnolia" and "Woke
Up Like This" (featuring Lil Uzi Vert). His debut studio album Die Lit
(2018) peaked at number 3 on the US Billboard 200. Following a
two-year hiatus with little-to-no new music released, Carter's highly
anticipated second album, Whole Lotta Red (2020), debuted at number
one on the Billboard 200 and became his first chart-topping

suburb Riverdale, Georgia. In a 2016 interview with Complex, he
stated, "My ma couldn't tell me shit. Nobody could tell me shit." This

sway away from the idea of pursuing a higher level of education after
high school. He attended North Springs Charter High School in Sandy
Springs.<br><br>Before rap, Carter wanted to become an NBA star to try and make
something of himself. In an interview with The Fader, he said, "I was
a young AI and didn't go to practice. That was the time I was really
ducking school and it was all hoop and no rap. I would smoke before
practice, get on the court and drop 30." He stopped playing basketball
after a disagreement with his coach. He then dedicated his time to
music.<br><br>Carter skipped high school classes regularly to
work on his music or go to his job at H&M, which led to Carti barely
graduating high school. In an interview with The Fader, he said, "I
was in class with freshmen finishing work, and if I finished the nine
assignments before this time I could graduate." He was so close to not
graduating that no one showed up to his graduation, because they
didn't know it was actually going to take place.<br><br>Carter

stores. He told Vogue that he was teased for being an early adopter of
