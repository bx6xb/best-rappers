professionally as Pop Smoke, was an American rapper. Born and raised
in Brooklyn, New York City, Pop Smoke began his musical career in late
2018 with his debut single "MPR (Panic Part 3 Remix)". He rose to fame
with the release of his breakout singles "Welcome to the Party" and
"Dior" in 2019. He often collaborated with UK drill artists and
producers, who employed more minimal and aggressive instrumentation
than American drill artists from Chicago, reintroducing the sound as
Brooklyn drill.<br><br>Following his rise to fame, record producer Rico Beats introduced Pop
Smoke to Steven Victor in April 2019. Victor would later have Pop
Smoke sign a recording contract with Victor Victor Worldwide and
Republic Records. He released his debut mixtape Meet the Woo in July
2019. His second mixtape, Meet the Woo 2, was released on February 7,
2020, and debuted at number seven on the Billboard 200, becoming the
rapper's first top-10 project in the United States. <br><br>Twelve days after the mixtape's release, Pop Smoke was murdered during
a home invasion in Los Angeles. New York rapper 50 Cent was the
executive producer of his posthumous debut studio album, Shoot for the
Stars, Aim for the Moon, released on July 3, 2020. The album debuted
at number one on the Billboard 200 and all 19 tracks from the album
were charted on the Billboard Hot 100. The album also spawned a string
of international top-10 singles, including "For the Night" (featuring
DaBaby and Lil Baby) and "What You Know Bout Love". A year later,
Republic Records released Pop Smoke's second studio album, Faith, on
July 16, 2021.<h3> Early life</h3><div class="sep"></div>Bashar Barakah Jackson was born on July 20, 1999, in Brooklyn, New
York City, to a Jamaican mother, Audrey Jackson, and a Panamanian
father, Greg Jackson. He had an older brother named Obasi. Jackson
attended nine different schools while growing up in Canarsie,
Brooklyn. He played the African drums in his local church as a child.<br><br>Jackson was expelled from eighth grade for bringing a gun to school.
He spent two years on house arrest after being charged with possessing
a weapon. Jackson started playing basketball as a point and shooting
guard. He relocated to Philadelphia to enroll in Rocktop Academy. He
was later forced to leave after being diagnosed with a heart murmur,
and Jackson eventually turned to street life.<h3> Career</h3><div class="sep"></div>In a Genius interview, he stated that his artist name of Pop Smoke is
a combination of Poppa, a name given to him by his Panamanian
grandmother, and Smocco Guwop, a nickname from childhood friends and
it was also his old Instagram name. He first attempted rapping during
a 2018 visit to a Brooklyn recording studio with Jay Gwuapo. In late
2018, he was rapping over a beat from 808Melo's YouTube channel,
Jackson recorded a track titled "MPR (Panic Part 3 Remix)" during the
session. On January 28, 2019, he released "Flexin'". Meanwhile,
Jackson befriended producer Rico Beats, who was acquainted with record
executive Steven Victor.<br><br>The three set up an interview, and in April 2019, Jackson signed to
Victor Victor Worldwide and Republic Records. On April 23, 2019,
Jackson released his breakout single, "Welcome to the Party", that was
produced by 808Melo. Many remixes of the song were later recorded,
with the commercially released versions featuring Nicki Minaj and the
other featuring Skepta. Jackson released his debut mixtape Meet the
Woo on July 26, 2019. From October to December 2019, Jackson released
multiple singles, including "War" with Lil Tjay, and "100k on a Coupe"
with Calboy.<br><br>On December 27, 2019, Jackson appeared on Travis Scott's Cactus Jack

accompanied by a music video. "Gatti" debuted and peaked at number 69
on the US Billboard Hot 100, giving Jackson his first Hot 100
appearance. On January 16, 2020, Jackson released "Christopher
Walking". On February 7, 2020, twelve days before his death, Jackson
released his second mixtape Meet the Woo 2, with features from Quavo,
A Boogie wit da Hoodie, Fivio Foreign and Lil Tjay.<br><br>The mixtape debuted at number seven on the US Billboard 200, earning
Jackson his first top-10 hit in the United States. Five days after its
release, a deluxe edition was released with three new songs, each
featuring a guest appearance, consisting of Nav, Gunna, and PnB Rock.
Jackson teased to social media his debut headlining concert tour Meet
the Woo Tour to promote both his mixtapes. The tour was planned to
begin in the US in March, and end in the UK in April.<h3> Posthumous releases</h3><div class="sep"></div>"Dior", the second single off Meet the Woo, became Jackson's first
posthumous solo hit, peaking at number 22 on the Billboard Hot 100 and
number 33 on the UK Singles Chart. At the beginning of March 2020,
American rapper 50 Cent announced on his Instagram that he had decided
to executive produce and finish Jackson's debut studio album. After
his announcement, 50 Cent called artists like Roddy Ricch, Drake, and
Chris Brown wanting to feature them on the record. Pop Smoke had
wanted to take his mother to an awards show prompting 50 Cent to
promise to take her to one when the album was complete.<br><br>On April 16, 2020, a documentary on Pop Smoke's life was announced to
be in the works. On May 14, 2020, Victor announced that Pop Smoke's
debut studio album would be posthumously released on June 12, 2020.
The album was named Shoot for the Stars, Aim for the Moon. It was
originally set for release on June 12, 2020, but was pushed back out
of respect for the George Floyd protests. Instead, on the album's
original release date, the lead single, "Make It Rain", featuring
fellow Brooklyn rapper Rowdy Rebel was released.<br><br>Rebel's verse was recorded through a collect call since he was
incarcerated at the time. Virgil Abloh created the album's original
artwork. The cover artwork provoked significant criticism from fans
who called it "lazy" and "rushed" and felt it was disrespectful. It
prompted a Change.org petition attracting tens of thousands of
signatures. Ryder Ripps created the final cover art with the chrome
rose against a black background. Jackson's mother chose the final
album cover hours before the album was released commercially.<br><br>The album was officially released on July 3, 2020, to commercial
success, reaching number one in several countries, including on the
Billboard 200. All 19 songs on the album charted on the Billboard Hot
100, with "For the Night" featuring Lil Baby and DaBaby, debuting and
peaking at number six, giving Pop Smoke his first top-10 hit in the
US. On July 20, 2020, which what would have been Jackson's 21st
birthday, a deluxe edition of the album was released, and featured 15
new additional tracks. <br><br>The album's fifth single "What You Know Bout Love", ended up peaking
at number nine on the Billboard Hot 100, giving Pop Smoke his second
top-10 hit in the US. On February 26, 2021, "AP" was released as the
lead single for the Boogie soundtrack. Pop Smoke was cast as Monk in a
minor role for Boogie. <br><br>Without assistance from 50 Cent, a second posthumous album titled
Faith was released on July 16, 2021, to mixed reviews. It debuted at
number one on the Billboard 200, making Pop Smoke the first artist to
have their first two posthumous albums debut at the top of the chart.
A deluxe version, featuring four additional tracks, was released on
July 20, 2021, which what would have been Jackson's 22nd birthday. Six
more tracks were added on July 30.<h3> Legal issues</h3><div class="sep"></div>On January 17, 2020, after returning from Paris Fashion Week, Jackson
was arrested by federal authorities at John F. Kennedy International
Airport after stealing a Rolls-Royce Wraith, valued at $375,000, whose
owner reported it stolen after Jackson had reportedly borrowed it in
California for a music video shoot on the condition it would be
returned the next day. Investigators believed he arranged for the car
to be transported on a flatbed truck to New York. He posted a photo of
himself in front of the stolen car on Instagram and Facebook. The car
was recovered by authorities at Jackson's mother's house, in the
Canarsie section of Brooklyn.<br><br>After his arrest, police questioned him about a non-fatal shooting
that took place in Brooklyn in June 2019. The police thought he had
information on the shooting because they claimed to have footage of
him driving a car in reverse near the scene of the crime. The police
also tried to pressure Jackson into telling them more information
about the Crips, GS9, and other Brooklyn street gangs, but he refused
to talk.<br><br>He was charged with grand theft auto, posted a $250,000 bond, and
agreed to stay away from known gang members and submit drug tests to
the US pretrial services. The conditions Jackson was put under
hindered some of his performances like the "BK Drip Concert" at Kings
Theatre in Flatbush in February 2020, as gang members were in the
audience.<h3> Death</h3><div class="sep"></div>On February 19, 2020, Jackson was renting a house through Airbnb owned
by The Real Housewives star Teddi Mellencamp and her husband, Edwin
Arroyave, in Hollywood Hills, California. At around 4:30 a.m., five
hooded men, including one wearing a ski mask and carrying a handgun,
broke into the house through a second-story balcony while Jackson was
taking a shower (it is unclear if Jackson was in the shower or not).
The intruders held a gun to a woman's head and threatened to kill her.
Shortly thereafter, the woman heard the men shoot Jackson three times
after an altercation.<br><br>The LAPD received news of the home invasion from a call from the East
Coast. Police arrived at the home six minutes later and found Jackson
with multiple gunshot wounds. He was rushed to Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center, where doctors performed a thoracotomy on the left side of his
chest.A few hours later, he was pronounced dead. He was 20 years old.
On February 21, the Los Angeles County Department of Medical
Examiner-Coroner revealed that the cause of Jackson's death was a
gunshot wound to the torso. <br><br>The LAPD at first suspected that Jackson's death was gang-related, as
he was tied to the Crips. However, the LAPD later believed his death
was the consequence of a home robbery gone wrong. It was believed the
intruders stole Jackson's gold watch and other jewelry before running
away from the house. In May 2021, a 15-year-old, the youngest of the
four intruders, allegedly admitted to killing Jackson over a
diamond-studded Rolex during a recorded interview with a cellmate at a
juvenile detention center. The 15-year-old told the cellmate that
Jackson at first complied with their requests for jewelry but then
tried to fight them, and a confrontation broke out in which Jackson
was pistol-whipped and shot with a Beretta M92. The intruders made off
with his Rolex, which they sold for $2,000.<br><br>The day before his murder, Jackson and friend Michael Durodola posted
several images on social media, including one in which Mellencamp's
home address can be seen in the background. The rapper also posted a
story on Instagram and Facebook of gifts he had received. One showed
the house's full address on the packaging, giving out its location.<br><br>Jackson's body was originally planned to be buried at the Cypress
Hills Cemetery but was later changed to Green-Wood Cemetery. Family,
friends, and fans of Jackson gathered in his hometown of Canarsie,
Brooklyn, to show their respects. His casket was pulled in a
horse-drawn carriage and was surrounded by glass windows and white
curtains. On September 11, 2021, it was discovered that his grave site
was vandalized, with the headstone smashed.<br><br>On July 9, 2020, three adult men and two minors were arrested for the
murder of the rapper. One of the adult suspects has been charged with
murder with a special circumstance that alleged the killing was
committed "during the commission of a robbery and a burglary", and
another charged with attempted murder. The two juveniles were charged
with murder and robbery in juvenile court. As California law requires
a minor to be at least 16 at the time of the crime, the 15-year-old
could not be tried as an adult; and, under George Gascón's policy to
keep all juveniles in juvenile court, the 17-year-old could not be
tried as an adult, either.<br><br>Remembrance<br><br>Jackson's parents, Audrey and Greg Jackson, shared memories of their
son before saying how gun violence took him away from them.<br><br>On February 19th, at 4:00 AM, a gun was used to take my son from me.
You know him as Pop Smoke, we called him 'Shar'. Because of gun
violence, I'll never see my son run up the front of our steps, taking
them two at a time; he won't ever take my hands again and dance with
me; he won't come into my room and muscle pose in the mirror. Gun
violence destroys families. It must stop. — Audrey Jackson during a
"Gun Violence Destroys Families" public service announcement<br><br>Danny Schwartz wrote in The Ringer that "Pop Smoke conquered New York
rap and gave the city the kind of readymade and potentially defining
star it hadn't seen in years". He claimed that "in New York City city,
'Welcome to the Party' was more omnipresent than hits like 'Old Town
Road'. <br><br>Jackson's work ethic was widely praised by his peers in the music
industry. The executive producer of his posthumous album, 50 Cent,
revealed Smoke was always "writing what said down" on his telephone,
while Quavo added he "felt like he was talking to somebody that had
been in the game for three years already".<br><br><Producer>Rico Beats stated that, in his last few months, Jackson</Producer><started>"telling kids, don't go the gang route", wanting to "be a</started><better>person".

tour by Pop Smoke. It was launched in support of his two mixtapes,
Meet the Woo (2019) and Meet the Woo 2 (2020), and had been set to
consist of concerts in North America and the United Kingdom. The tour
was announced in January 2020, with dates being released at the same
time. Pop Smoke later added more UK tour dates after high demand from
fans. The tour was canceled after Pop Smoke was shot and killed.<br><br>Tour dates were released on the same day for North America, while
dates for the United Kingdom were revealed in February. Due to high
demand from fans, more tour dates for the UK were revealed on February
13, 2020. Pop Smoke shared a promotional flyer for the tour on social
media. Pop Smoke and his team were planning on finishing, mixing, and
mastering his debut studio album Shoot for the Stars, Aim for the
Moon, starting the first week of March 2020.<br><br>In an interview with Revolt, Pop Smoke's DJ Jeffrey Archer talked
about the tour. "Honestly, it's nothing planned yet. We just got those
dates. This is officially going to be our first real big tour. This is
going to be a month. I’m very excited about it. We're going to a few
places we've never been to. We've been getting feedback over the last
seven months fans like, 'Please come out here.' There are loyal fans
at these shows. You should expect a lot more music and shows. He has a
lot of music coming out with a lot of artists. He’s not playing. We're
definitely shaking the room in 2020."<br><br>Tour cancellation<br><br>The Meet the Woo Tour was later canceled after Pop Smoke was killed by
a torso wound at the age of 20 in a home invasion on February 19,
2020. Four hooded men, including one wearing a ski mask and carrying a
handgun, broke into a house he was renting in Hollywood Hills,
California, and shot him twice in the chest. Fans were offered refunds
after Pop Smoke's death: "As we mourn the loss of this great artist,
refunds will be available at point of purchase."</div></div><div class="col-12 rapper-info-section hide"><div class="albums"><h3> Faith</h3><img src="../img/pop_smoke/albums/faith.jpg" alt="faith album" title="faith album"><div class="album-desc"> Faith is the second and final studio album by American rapper
