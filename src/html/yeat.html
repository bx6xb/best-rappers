          <hr />
          Noah Olivier Smith, born February 26 2000, known professionally as
          Yeat, is an American rapper, singer-songwriter, and record producer.
          He gained recognition in mid-2021 after the release of his mixtape 4L
          and debut studio album Up 2 Me, with tracks from the latter, including
          "Money So Big" and "Get Busy" gaining popularity on TikTok.
          <br /><br />
          In 2022, he released his second studio album 2 Alive, and the EP Lyfe;
          both projects debuted in the top ten on the Billboard 200. In 2023, he
          released his third studio album, Afterlyfe, which debuted at number
          four on the Billboard 200.
          <div class="text-header">Early life</div>
          <hr />
          Noah Olivier Smith was born on February 26, 2000, in Irvine,
          California. Smith is of Romanian descent through his mother and
          Mexican and European-American descent through his father. In an
          interview with Our Generation Music, he stated his paternal
          grandmother is from Mexico and is from the Mexican city of Tijuana
          while his paternal grandfather is white but he does not know what his
          grandfather's specific ethnic background is. Yeat has two brothers,
          Luca and Ethan. Yeat spent his childhood in Fullerton, California
          before he and his family moved to Portland, Oregon, he attended
          Lakeridge High School in Lake Oswego, Oregon. After graduating, Yeat
          moved to New York City to pursue his music career before eventually
          moving to Los Angeles, where he currently lives.
          <div class="text-header">Career</div>
          <hr />
          <span>2015–2021: Career beginnings</span><br /><br />
          Yeat began his career in 2015, originally making music under the name
          Lil Yeat, but these releases have since been deleted from the
          Internet. On June 30, 2018, Yeat made his first public appearance
          under his current moniker, premiering a track called "Brink" on
          Elevator, a YouTube channel. Yeat has stated that he created the name
          Yeat while high and trying to come up with one word that sounds
          familiar to people. His stage name has also been described as a
          combination of "yeet" and "heat". Yeat has mentioned how his use of
          LSD was able to help him pursue his music career. He released his
          first mixtape, Deep Blue Strips on September 20, 2018. On February 21,
          2019, he premiered the music video for his track "Stay Up" on
          Elevator. <br /><br />
          <span>2021–2022: Viral success, Up 2 Me and 2 Alive</span>
          <br /><br />
          Yeat achieved viral success online through platforms such as TikTok in
          2021. Writing for Pitchfork, Mano Sundaresan commented "Cutting his
          teeth in the influential online rap collective Slayworld over the last
          few years, Yeat was always a little stranger than his peers, and
          consequently cast as a minor figure. But in 2021, his surrealist bent
          became his superpower." Yeat's music began to gain traction online
          following his 4L mixtape, which was released June 11, 2021. The 4L
          project notably included "Sorry Bout That" and "Money Twerk".
          <br /><br />
          In August, he released the EP Trendi which had increased success with
          "Mad Bout That" and "Fukit". Also in August, a snippet of his song
          "Get Busy" went viral online, attracting considerable media and fan
          attention upon its release. The song was particularly cited by media
          outlets for its line "this song already was turnt but here's a bell",
          which was immediately followed by the ringing of church bells (which
          are often incorporated into his songs). Fellow rappers Drake and Lil
          Yachty also referenced the line.
          <br /><br />
          On September 10, Yeat released his debut studio album Up 2 Me through
          an initial one-album deal with Interscope Records and Foundation
          Media. The album received generally positive reception from critics.
          After the limited Interscope and Foundation deal had ended, Yeat
          fulfilled a promise he made to Zack Bia by signing with the latter's
          Field Trip Recordings, in addition to Conor Ambrose's Listen to the
          Kids, in a joint venture with Geffen Records and Interscope Records.
          <br /><br />
          On January 22, 2022, Up 2 Me made its debut on the Billboard 200,
          initially reaching number 183 and ultimately peaking at number 58.
          Later that same month, Yeat teased a mid-February release date for his
          next album, 2 Alive. His song "U Could Tell" was featured in the
          Euphoria episode "You Who Cannot See, Think of Those Who Can", which
          premiered on January 30. <br /><br />
          On February 11, the single "Still Countin" was released alongside a
          Cole Bennett-directed music video. On February 18, Yeat released his
          second studio album, 2 Alive, through Geffen Records, Field Trip
          Recordings, Listen to the Kids, and Twizzy Rich. It debuted and peaked
          at number six on the Billboard 200, selling around 36,000 units and
          becoming his highest charting project. On April 1, the deluxe version
          of 2 Alive, titled 2 Alive (Geek Pack), was released. On April 29, he
          released "No Handoutz", a collaborative single with Internet Money
          Records.
          <br /><br />
          On June 28, Yeat released "Rich Minion", a single he was commissioned
          to create for a Lyrical Lemonade-produced trailer promoting the film
          Minions: The Rise of Gru. After its release, the song became
          associated with "GentleMinions", a meme involving people who would
          dress in formal attire and attend screenings of the film while it was
          playing in movie theatres during the summer of 2022. <br /><br />
          <span>2022–present: Lyfe and Afterlyfe</span> <br /><br />
          On September 2, 2022, Yeat released "Talk", a single from his EP Lyfe.
          The EP itself was released a week later on September 9, debuting and
          peaking at number ten on the Billboard 200.
          <br /><br />
          On October 21, Yeat was featured on rapper YoungBoy Never Broke
          Again's song "I Don't Text Back", a track included on the latter's
          mixtape Ma' I Got a Family. <br /><br />
          On February 24, 2023, Yeat released his third studio album, Afterlyfe.
          The album includes a feature from YoungBoy Never Broke Again, in
          addition to Yeat's alter egos Kranky Kranky and Luh Geeky. It peaked
          at number four on the Billboard 200 and number one on the Billboard
          Rap Albums chart. <br /><br />
          <div class="text-header">Musical style</div>
          <hr />
          Yeat began making music that had Auto-Tune-infused vocals. In 2021, he
          adopted a more aggressive and synth-based sound, joining a growing
          group of rappers that used "rage beats", a sound that became a
          SoundCloud staple influenced by the lively vocal deliveries and
          EDM-influenced beat selections of artists such as Playboi Carti,
          specifically on Whole Lotta Red (2020). His vocal style has drawn
          comparisons to Playboi Carti, Future, and Young Thug. Yeat has stated
          the latter two are some of his biggest inspirations. He also cited
          American rapper T-Pain as one of his biggest influences growing up,
          calling him "The GOAT of Auto-Tune". Yeat's signature vocal preset is
          based on a vocal chain given to him by frequent collaborator and
          fellow musician Weiland. <br /><br />
          Yeat has also been noted to employ a unique lingo in his music, coming
          up with ad-libs and phrases such as "twizzy", "krank", and "luh
          geeky", and often referencing Tonka in his lyrics. His father was one
          of the inspirations for him creating these unique words, as he himself
          would make up his own words when Yeat was a child.
          <br /><br />
          Certain aspects of Yeat's music have led him to be associated with
          various Internet memes and trends, especially the frequent use of bell
          sounds in his music. <br /><br />

            Alivë is Yeat’s third mixtape and his first release of 2021. The
            project was highly anticipated by Yeat’s fans as there was a long
            wait for the project due to label troubles Yeat was experiencing,
            and constant previews. Alivë was originally a twenty-track project,
            however, two bonus tracks were added, “Sleeptalking” and “Evëry
            Sunday.”
