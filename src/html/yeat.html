Yeat, is an American rapper, singer-songwriter, and record producer.
He gained recognition in mid-2021 after the release of his mixtape 4L
and debut studio album Up 2 Me, with tracks from the latter, including
"Money So Big" and "Get Busy" gaining popularity on TikTok.<br/><br/>In 2022, he released his second studio album 2 Alive, and the EP Lyfe;
both projects debuted in the top ten on the Billboard 200. In 2023, he
released his third studio album, Afterlyfe, which debuted at number
four on the Billboard 200.<h3> Early life</h3><div class="sep"></div>Noah Olivier Smith was born on February 26, 2000, in Irvine,
California. Smith is of Romanian descent through his mother and
Mexican and European-American descent through his father. In an
interview with Our Generation Music, he stated his paternal
grandmother is from Mexico and is from the Mexican city of Tijuana
while his paternal grandfather is white but he does not know what his
grandfather's specific ethnic background is. Yeat has two brothers,
Luca and Ethan. Yeat spent his childhood in Fullerton, California
before he and his family moved to Portland, Oregon, he attended
Lakeridge High School in Lake Oswego, Oregon. After graduating, Yeat
moved to New York City to pursue his music career before eventually
moving to Los Angeles, where he currently lives.<h3> Career</h3><div class="sep"></div>2015–2021: Career beginnings<br/><br/>Yeat began his career in 2015, originally making music under the name
Lil Yeat, but these releases have since been deleted from the
Internet. On June 30, 2018, Yeat made his first public appearance
under his current moniker, premiering a track called "Brink" on
Elevator, a YouTube channel. Yeat has stated that he created the name
Yeat while high and trying to come up with one word that sounds
familiar to people. His stage name has also been described as a
combination of "yeet" and "heat". Yeat has mentioned how his use of
LSD was able to help him pursue his music career. He released his
first mixtape, Deep Blue Strips on September 20, 2018. On February 21,
2019, he premiered the music video for his track "Stay Up" on
Elevator.<br/><br/>2021–2022: Viral success, Up 2 Me and 2 Alive<br/><br/>Yeat achieved viral success online through platforms such as TikTok in
2021. Writing for Pitchfork, Mano Sundaresan commented "Cutting his
teeth in the influential online rap collective Slayworld over the last
few years, Yeat was always a little stranger than his peers, and
consequently cast as a minor figure. But in 2021, his surrealist bent
became his superpower." Yeat's music began to gain traction online
following his 4L mixtape, which was released June 11, 2021. The 4L
project notably included "Sorry Bout That" and "Money Twerk".<br/><br/>In August, he released the EP Trendi which had increased success with
"Mad Bout That" and "Fukit". Also in August, a snippet of his song
"Get Busy" went viral online, attracting considerable media and fan
attention upon its release. The song was particularly cited by media
outlets for its line "this song already was turnt but here's a bell",
which was immediately followed by the ringing of church bells (which
are often incorporated into his songs). Fellow rappers Drake and Lil
Yachty also referenced the line.<br/><br/>On September 10, Yeat released his debut studio album Up 2 Me through
an initial one-album deal with Interscope Records and Foundation
Media. The album received generally positive reception from critics.
After the limited Interscope and Foundation deal had ended, Yeat
fulfilled a promise he made to Zack Bia by signing with the latter's
Field Trip Recordings, in addition to Conor Ambrose's Listen to the
Kids, in a joint venture with Geffen Records and Interscope Records.<br/><br/>On January 22, 2022, Up 2 Me made its debut on the Billboard 200,
initially reaching number 183 and ultimately peaking at number 58.
Later that same month, Yeat teased a mid-February release date for his
next album, 2 Alive. His song "U Could Tell" was featured in the
Euphoria episode "You Who Cannot See, Think of Those Who Can", which
premiered on January 30.<br/><br/>On February 11, the single "Still Countin" was released alongside a
Cole Bennett-directed music video. On February 18, Yeat released his
second studio album, 2 Alive, through Geffen Records, Field Trip
Recordings, Listen to the Kids, and Twizzy Rich. It debuted and peaked
at number six on the Billboard 200, selling around 36,000 units and
becoming his highest charting project. On April 1, the deluxe version
of 2 Alive, titled 2 Alive (Geek Pack), was released. On April 29, he
released "No Handoutz", a collaborative single with Internet Money
Records.<br/><br/>On June 28, Yeat released "Rich Minion", a single he was commissioned
to create for a Lyrical Lemonade-produced trailer promoting the film
Minions: The Rise of Gru. After its release, the song became
associated with "GentleMinions", a meme involving people who would
dress in formal attire and attend screenings of the film while it was
playing in movie theatres during the summer of 2022.<br/><br/>2022–present: Lyfe and Afterlyfe<br/><br/>On September 2, 2022, Yeat released "Talk", a single from his EP Lyfe.
The EP itself was released a week later on September 9, debuting and
peaking at number ten on the Billboard 200.<br/><br/>On October 21, Yeat was featured on rapper YoungBoy Never Broke
Again's song "I Don't Text Back", a track included on the latter's
mixtape Ma' I Got a Family.<br/><br/>On February 24, 2023, Yeat released his third studio album, Afterlyfe.
The album includes a feature from YoungBoy Never Broke Again, in
addition to Yeat's alter egos Kranky Kranky and Luh Geeky. It peaked
at number four on the Billboard 200 and number one on the Billboard
Rap Albums chart.<br/><br/><h3> Musical style</h3><div class="sep"></div>Yeat began making music that had Auto-Tune-infused vocals. In 2021, he
adopted a more aggressive and synth-based sound, joining a growing
group of rappers that used "rage beats", a sound that became a
SoundCloud staple influenced by the lively vocal deliveries and
EDM-influenced beat selections of artists such as Playboi Carti,
specifically on Whole Lotta Red (2020). His vocal style has drawn
comparisons to Playboi Carti, Future, and Young Thug. Yeat has stated
the latter two are some of his biggest inspirations. He also cited
American rapper T-Pain as one of his biggest influences growing up,
calling him "The GOAT of Auto-Tune". Yeat's signature vocal preset is
based on a vocal chain given to him by frequent collaborator and
fellow musician Weiland.<br/><br/>Yeat has also been noted to employ a unique lingo in his music, coming
up with ad-libs and phrases such as "twizzy", "krank", and "luh
geeky", and often referencing Tonka in his lyrics. His father was one
of the inspirations for him creating these unique words, as he himself
would make up his own words when Yeat was a child.<br/><br/>Certain aspects of Yeat's music have led him to be associated with
various Internet memes and trends, especially the frequent use of bell
sounds in his music.</div></div><div class="col-12 rapper-info-section hide"><div class="albums"><h3> AftërLyfe</h3><img src="../img/yeat/albums/afterlyfe.jpg" alt="afterlyfe album" title="afterlyfe album"/><div class="album-desc"> Afterlyfe is the third studio album by American rapper Yeat.
