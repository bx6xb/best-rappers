              Bashar Barakah Jackson (July 20, 1999 – February 19, 2020), known
              professionally as Pop Smoke, was an American rapper. Born and
              raised in Brooklyn, New York City, Pop Smoke began his musical
              career in late 2018 with his debut single "MPR (Panic Part 3
              Remix)". He rose to fame with the release of his breakout singles
              "Welcome to the Party" and "Dior" in 2019. He often collaborated
              with UK drill artists and producers, who employed more minimal and
              aggressive instrumentation than American drill artists from
              Chicago, reintroducing the sound as Brooklyn drill.
